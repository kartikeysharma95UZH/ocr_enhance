'''
schneipiseg algorithm explanation:

1) apply a couple of morpholgy operations, such as opening, dilation, substraction, addition and inversion, on the image
2) after the final operations, search for connectedcomponents, representing the text lines
3) for each component analyze the horizontal histogram (projection) and possibly split the text line into multiple ones
4) we then adjust the boxes so that they are increased in height, so they do not go out of bounds, and so that they have PAD
5) a final algorithm looks at the boxes and possibly merges some, in case they are overlapping too much or are contained inside each other

# x1 and y1 cant be below 0
# x2 and y2 cant be so that x2>image_w or y2>image_h
# also: we extend the height of the line in both directions using P8
# also: we readjust the coordinates so they consider LINE_IMG_PAD

	'''
	algorithm idea:
	- combine boxes that have similar vertical coordinates, so that they represent the same text line
	- sort list of boxes using increasing y
	- iterate over sorted list:
		- if new box is contained in previous one (new_y1 > prev_y1 and new_y2 < prev_y2), it is the same line
		- else if OVERLAP_THRESH_SEG and OVERLAP2_THRESH_SEG determine whether they overlap enough to represent the same line
		- else it is a new line
		- only in last two cases we update the current/new box to be the previous box in the next iteration
